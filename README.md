A minimalistic python interpreter written in c, just to see where i can get to :)

Currently in a very initial version with mem leaks all over the place since i don't care for now, exceptions, garbage collection not implemented

Things that -barely- work can be seen inside test_interpret.c

Needs glib-dev and readline library installed

make all and everything is compiled

Things can be tried using repl.out
